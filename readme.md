# A Comic Of Zombies
zombocalypse have come, you are one of the last survivors on earth! So try to stay alive in a never ending fight for survival! Help President Obama in his road to White House.

A Comic Of Zombies is a videogame developed using Monogame. It used to be a paid iOs game but it's not published anymore in the app store so I opened source it just in case someone wants to learn how it works.

[MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) is a simple and powerful open source .NET library for creating games for desktop PCs, video game consoles, and mobile devices.

Right now I'm working on the Windows OpenGL version.
## License
The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).  
You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch 
is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the 
entire source code available for free to everyone.

The primary intent of this release is for entertainment and educational 
purposes, but the GPL does allow commercial exploitation if you obey the 
full license.  If you want to do something commercial and you just can't bear 
to have your source changes released, we could still negotiate a separate 
license agreement (for $$$), but I would encourage you to just live with the 
GPL.

All of the data files and graphic assets (under the Content folder) remain copyrighted, 
I mean, they are my property because I love them!!!!
