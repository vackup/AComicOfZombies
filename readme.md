# A Comic Of Zombies
zombocalypse have come, you are one of the last survivors on earth! So try to stay alive in a never ending fight for survival! Help President Obama in his road to White House.

It was 2010 / 2011 and I wanted to become millionaire selling mobile games. There were 2 problems, I had never developed a video game and I had never developed a mobile app. I started with [Microsoft XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) and its [platformer starter kit](https://www.google.com/search?q=xna+platformer+starter+kit). Once I had something playable I had to convert it into a mobile app. I had the Windows Phone version which helped me a lot but I wanted an iOS version. I started playing with [ExEn](http://andrewrussell.net/exen/), Monotouch and Monodroid (Xamarin didn't exist at that time and there was a company called [Ximian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ximian)). Then I bought a Mac Mini, and iPod touch, a licence of Monotouch, gave some money to help Andrew Russel to finish ExEn (Monogame was full of bugs), pay an artist, managed to finish the first version of A Comic Of Zombies and published it to the App Store. 

I did not become a millionaire, but I learned and enjoyed a lot. Also I met many wonderful people along the way. Part of this story can be seen in its [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/acomicofzombies/)

It used to be a paid iOs game but it's not published anymore in the app store. Currently, A Comic Of Zombies is a videogame developed using [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) that I decided to open source it just in case someone wants to learn how it works, wants to learn more about me or is just curious. Right now I'm working on the Windows OpenGL version.

This is my little tribute to a piece of software that I love so much and it made me so happy.

## License
The code is all licensed under the terms of the [GPL (gnu public license)](https://github.com/vackup/AComicOfZombies/blob/master/LICENSE).
You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch 
is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the 
entire source code available for free to everyone.

The primary intent of this release is for entertainment and educational 
purposes, but the GPL does allow commercial exploitation if you obey the 
full license.  If you want to do something commercial and you just can't bear 
to have your source changes released, we could still negotiate a separate 
license agreement (for $$$), but I would encourage you to just live with the 
GPL.

All of the data files and graphic assets (under the Content folder) remain copyrighted, 
I mean, they are my property because I love them!!!!
